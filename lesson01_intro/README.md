# Lesson 1 – Introduction to Python and Optimization

**Goal:**  
Learn basic Python syntax, understand how variables work, and explore how optimization helps us make better decisions.

### Concepts Covered
- Variables and simple calculations  
- Printing and combining text with numbers  
- Common math operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`)  
- A mini optimization example: maximizing the number of candies you can buy with limited money  

### Files
- `lesson01_intro.py` — main Python code for this lesson  

### Next Steps
Experiment with the code:
- Change variable values and observe the results.  
- Add your own examples of simple optimizations in daily life.
