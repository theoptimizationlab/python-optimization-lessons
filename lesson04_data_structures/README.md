# Lesson 4 – Data Structures: Organizing Options

**Goal**  
Learn how to store and organize many options using Python data structures, then use loops to compare them and make decisions.

### Concepts Covered
- Lists for ordered collections of values  
- Tuples for grouped attributes (e.g., `(time, fun)`)  
- Dictionaries for key–value pairs (e.g., item → price)  
- Looping over lists and dictionaries  
- Using data structures in simple optimization problems  
  - Find the largest / smallest value  
  - Filter options under a budget  
  - Choose the best option by a score
