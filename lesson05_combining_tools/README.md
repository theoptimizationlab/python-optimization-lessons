# Lesson 5 – Combining Conditions, Loops, and Functions

**Goal**  
Use conditions, loops, and functions *together* to model simple optimization problems:
- Enforce constraints  
- Evaluate each option  
- Keep the best one

### Concepts Covered
- Filter + min pattern (budget + cheapest item)
- Multi-criteria scoring (time + transfers, fun + weight)
- Using functions as scoring rules
- Using loops to search over many options
- "Best-so-far" logic under constraints

### Files
- `lesson05_combining_tools.py` — main examples for this lesson  
- `lesson05_practice_solutions.py` — example solutions to the practice problems  

### Practice Highlights
1. Budget picker: cheapest feasible item under a budget  
2. Routes with time and transfers using a scoring function  
3. Snack tradeoff with fun and weight  
4. Filter-then-best for chores under a time limit  
5. Challenge: general selector `best_choice(options, score_fn)`
