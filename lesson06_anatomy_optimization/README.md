# Lesson 6 – Anatomy of an Optimization Problem

**Goal**  
Understand how to break a word problem into the standard pieces of an optimization model:

- **Decision variables** – what we control  
- **Objective function** – what we want to maximize or minimize  
- **Constraints** – rules/limits that must be satisfied  
- **Feasible region** – all solutions that satisfy the constraints  

### Concepts Covered
- Translating from words to math:
  - Define variables (what each variable represents)
  - Write the objective (maximize or minimize)
  - Write constraints (budgets, limits, at least / at most)
  - Include nonnegativity (`x ≥ 0`) and type (integer, binary if needed)
- Feasibility vs. optimality:
  - Check which options satisfy all constraints before choosing the best one

### Files
- `lesson06_anatomy_optimization.py` — small Python examples representing the structure and feasibility checks  
- `lesson06_practice_solutions.py` — written formulations for the practice problems (variables, objective, constraints)
