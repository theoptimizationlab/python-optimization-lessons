# Lesson 3 – Functions: Building Blocks for Optimization

**Goal**  
Understand how to create and use functions in Python and apply them to optimization problems.

### Concepts Covered
- Defining a function with `def`
- Using parameters and return values
- Functions with one or more inputs
- Reusing formulas as functions
- Combining functions with loops to test many options
- Building scoring rules for optimization

### Files
- `lesson03_functions.py` — main code for this lesson  
- `lesson03_practice_solutions.py` — example solutions to the practice problems  

### Practice Highlights
1. Write and test `square(x)`  
2. Create `max_of_two(a, b)` without using `max()`  
3. Check affordability for multiple prices  
4. Calculate a route score and pick the best  
5. Challenge: find the best affordable item `(price, fun)` under a budget
