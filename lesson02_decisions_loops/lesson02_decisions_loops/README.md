# Lesson 2 – Decisions & Loops: Searching for the Best

**Goal:**  
Use conditions and loops to explore many options, check constraints, and keep the best one.

### Concepts Covered
- Boolean expressions and comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`)
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
- `if`, `elif`, `else` decision rules
- Loops with `range(...)` and over lists
- Accumulation pattern for totals and averages
- “Best-so-far” pattern for finding minimums and maximums
- Combining constraints with best-so-far (feasible and best)

### Files
- `lesson02_decisions_loops.py` — main Python code for the lesson  

### Practice
Use the exercises in the Lesson 2 handout to:
- Classify numbers as even/odd  
- Decide when to "buy" or "skip" based on a budget  
- Choose transport modes for different distances and weather conditions  
- Compute averages from lists  
- Find the best route, rating, or item under constraints
