# Lesson 2 – Decisions & Loops: Searching for the Best

**Goal**  
Use conditions and loops to explore many options, check constraints, and keep the best one.

### Concepts Covered
- Boolean expressions and comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`)
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
- `if`, `elif`, `else` decision rules
- Loops with `range(...)` and over lists
- Accumulation pattern for totals and averages
- “Best-so-far” pattern for finding minimums and maximums
- Combining constraints with best-so-far (feasible *and* best)

### Files
- `lesson02_decisions_loops.py` — main Python code for the lesson  
- `lesson02_practice_solutions.py` — example solutions to the practice problems
